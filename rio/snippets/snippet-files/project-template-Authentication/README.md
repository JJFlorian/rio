# Authentication

This template demonstrates a basic authentication app utilizing SQLite.

## Lessons

In this example we will demonstrate:

-   How to implement and use a `Persistence` class to manage your database operations.
-   How to attach the `Persistence` class to your app using `on_app_start`.
-   How to restore sessions so valid users don't need to log in again, using `on_session_start`.
-   How to create security `guards` to protect your app, ensuring users without proper access rights cannot access restricted areas.
